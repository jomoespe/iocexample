Go IoC simple stupid example
============================

Implements a IoC sample. There is an API (*sender.Sender*), a SPI interface (*sender.Receiver*) and a SPI implementation (*receiver.SpecificReceiver*). The "context" is bound in *main.App*.

Perhaps I should *give another round to the theme*.


## Requisites

  - Tested on **Go** version 1.5.1+


## Run the application

    go run App.go
